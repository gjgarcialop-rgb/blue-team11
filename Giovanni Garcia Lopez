## About me
I am Giovanni, I am a junior at UNCG and love Computer Science. I hope to develop it into cyber security or data analysis. I am also a Gurantee scholar at UNCG and like doing community service.
## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to develop my coding skills to understand what I can do for others. I also hope to apply my skills that I learned from previous classes into projects and assingments in better use.
